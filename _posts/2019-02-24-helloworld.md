Hi there! Welcome to my blog!

After a couple of years of anonymous blogging during my middle school and early high school years (and a writer's block), it seems that I'm back to my old ways.

I'm currently debating on whether I should use emojis/gifs in my blog or not. Part of me argues it's high time I deal with this emoji/gif addiction of mine. However, I fear that the emoji and gif forces are too strong to fight.

Oh, and for anyone who's wondering about the strange name of the blog, it's supposed to be a play on the word 'poetic'; coined from the two words 'poem' and 'technology'.

> Poetic && Poetech

Now, let me be honest.

I'm not sure how many posts are going to have my poems, how many are going to have my explorations with tech and coding, and how many are going to be musings on life.

I just wanted to make that 'poetic' pun.

What I do hope though, is that I'll keep this blog alive. What I do hope though, is that this will be my tiny hideout in the vast internet.

There is so much to learn! There is so much to read! There is so much to write!

And for you, my dear reader, according to Sturgeon's law, 90% of the posts over here may be trash. However, I hope that the remaining 10% will make it worth venturing this cozy corner of the internet.

I'm just a soldier in training (college student), after all.

Now then, without further ado, let's get this blog started!
