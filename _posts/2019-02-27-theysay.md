□□□□□'s friend's brother swears

That he heard his martyred brother

Cry into the night

"AVENGE ME" he said

(So he hears so when darkness strikes)

<br />

■■■■■'s friend's sister swears

That she heard her martyred sister

Cry into the night

"AVENGE ME" she said

(So she hears so when darkness strikes)

<br />

So did we!

Agree the villagers

As they rise to protect

(Vengeance)

<br />


So did we!

Agrees the town nearby

As they rise to protect

(Vengeance!)

<br />


So did we!

Agrees the city nearby

As they rise to protect

(Vengeance!!)

<br />


So did we!

Agrees the nation

As they rise to protect

(VENGEANCE!!!)

<br />


SO DID WE!!

AGREE NATIONS

AS THEY RISE TO PROTECT

(VENGEANCE!!!!)

<br />

□□□□□'s friend's brother swears

That he no longer hears people

And their voices cross into the night

"Long departed" he says

(So he claims so when darkness strikes)

<br />

■■■■■■'s friend's sister swears

That she no longer hears people

And their voices cross into the night

"Long departed" she says

(So she claims so when darkness strikes)

<br />


So it is

Everyone agrees

As they scramble to protect

The almighty swears

That they hear millions of people

Scream into the night

But there is no one else to hear them.
